      "To be eligible for B.Tech at MBITS, students must have passed 10+2 or equivalent with Physics and Mathematics as compulsory subjects, along with one optional subject like Chemistry, Biology, Biotechnology, or Computer Science, with a minimum aggregate score of 50%. Admission requires qualifying the KEAM entrance exam conducted by Kerala‚Äôs Commissioner for Entrance Examinations.",
      "Admission to the B.Tech program at MBITS follows a semester-based examination system and offers lateral entry for diploma holders directly into the 3rd semester. Seat allocation is equally divided with 50% for government quota seats allotted through KEAM rank, and 50% for management quota seats allotted based on KEAM rank and/or qualifying exam marks.",
      "Students without Chemistry but having Physics, Mathematics, and one optional subject from the approved list are eligible. Lateral entry candidates must also meet similar eligibility criteria and seats for lateral entry are divided equally between government and management quotas. A merit scholarship reserves 10% of seats without tuition fees for economically backward, meritorious students under AICTE fee waiver.",
      "For all specializations including Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics & Communication, Computer Science, and Data Science, the eligibility criteria remain the same: pass in 10+2 with Physics and Maths plus one optional subject and qualifying KEAM. Diploma holders can join through lateral entry with half the seats reserved for government quota and half for management quota.",
      "Management quota seats are allocated based on KEAM rank or qualifying examination marks. Additionally, students from minority communities or those scoring above 80% in 12th standard with parental income below ‚Çπ6 lakhs per annum are eligible for scholarships. The entire B.Tech course duration is 4 years, offered full-time and affiliated with Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam."

On Wednesdays, students should wear a specific color dress, usually white or light colors, to promote uniformity. Saturdays have a different dress color, such as blue or any other assigned color, making it easy to identify the day. Girls are expected to dress neatly and formally, maintaining a professional and respectful appearance in the campus. Casual clothes are not allowed during academic hours. The dress code helps maintain discipline and professionalism."
